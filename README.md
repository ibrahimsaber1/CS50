# CS50 Problem Sets Repository

Welcome to the **CS50 Problem Sets Repository**! This repository is designed to consolidate and organize problem sets and projects from various CS50 courses, focusing on different domains of computer science and programming.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a collection of solutions to the problem sets from CS50 courses, along with additional projects and exercises to reinforce core concepts. Each course is categorized under its respective directory to facilitate easy navigation.

### Structure of the Repository

- **python/**: Contains problem sets from the **CS50 Introduction to Programming Using Python** course. Each problem set is organized by weeks, making it easier for learners to track their progress and revisit specific exercises.

### CS50 Python Course: Problem Sets Overview

The **CS50 Introduction to Programming Using Python** course dives deep into the fundamentals of Python, offering a series of problem sets designed to challenge and build programming skills. Below is an overview of the problem sets included:

- **Week 0**: Introduction to programming and problem-solving with Python basics. Learners start with simple programs, understanding data types, variables, and basic input/output.
- **Week 1**: Focus on conditions and loops, enabling students to create dynamic programs using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements alongside loops like `for` and `while`.
- **Week 2**: Introduction to functions, including function definition, scope, and usage in problem-solving.
- **Week 3**: Exploring data structures in Python, such as lists and dictionaries, and their applications in various problem sets.
- **Week 4**: File handling and exceptions, allowing learners to read and write data to files and handle errors effectively.
- **Week 5**: Understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, covering classes, objects, and inheritance.
- **Week 6**: Working with external libraries and APIs to perform more complex tasks.
- **Week 7**: Final exercises that challenge students to integrate their knowledge from previous weeks and solve comprehensive problems.
- **Week 8**: Advanced topics and a review of concepts to solidify learning.

### Final Project: DV Lottery Application

In addition to the weekly problem sets, the repository includes a comprehensive final project titled **DV Lottery Application**. This project simulates a simplified version of the Diversity Visa (DV) Lottery system, allowing users to submit applications and randomly select winners. Below is an overview of the project:

- **Project Description**: The DV Lottery Application allows users to submit applications by providing essential details such as their name, date of birth, city of birth, nationality, education level, and optional contact information. The program validates each application based on specific rules and stores valid and invalid entries separately. A winner is randomly selected from the pool of valid entries.

- **Key Features**:
  - **User Input and Validation**: The application prompts users to input various details and validates them against defined rules, such as age restrictions, valid education levels, and disallowed nationalities.
  - **Data Storage**: Valid and invalid applications are stored in separate CSV files, making it easy to review and analyze entries.
  - **Random Winner Selection**: The program includes a feature to select a random winner from the pool of valid applications.
  - **Test Suite**: A set of tests using `pytest` is provided to ensure the integrity and functionality of the DV Lottery Application.

This project demonstrates key programming concepts such as data validation, file handling, randomness, and modular programming. It serves as a capstone project for the **CS50 Introduction to Programming Using Python** course, consolidating all the skills learned throughout the course.

## Future Plans

In addition to the **CS50 Python** section, this repository will expand to include solutions to other CS50 courses such as **CS50x** and **CS50 Web Development**. Each new course will have its own directory, with detailed documentation for each problem set and project.

Stay tuned for more updates and additions to this repository as I continue my journey through the CS50 curriculum!
